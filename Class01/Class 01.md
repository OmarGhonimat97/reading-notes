## Pain and Suffering


[Pain and suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

The pain that you’ll experience during this course is no exception; most times it won’t feel good. You won’t feel good.
"Good to know"

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

[Facts and Myths about Python names and values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)
Ned Batchelder PyCon 2015

### Facts:
- Names refer to values.
- Many names can refer to one value
- Names are reassigned independently
- Values live until no references
- Assignment never copies data
- Changes are visible through all names
- Immutable values can't alias, immutable types: ints, floats, strings, tuples

"Change" is unclear
- Chaning an int: rebinding
- Chaning a list: mutating
- Can also rebind lists, but Can't mutate an int: ints are immutable

Mutable and immutable are assigned the same
- Assignment is the same for all values
- Alising can make it seem different
