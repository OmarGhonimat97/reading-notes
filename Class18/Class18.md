## Encryption, Decryption & Cracking

- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

## Caesar Cipher

One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.
The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity.

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.

## Diffie-Hellman

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange was one of the most important developments in public-key cryptography and it is still frequently implemented in a range of today’s different security protocols.

It allows two parties who have not previously met to securely establish a key which they can use to secure their communications. In this article, we’ll explain what it’s used for, how it works on a step-by-step basis, its different variations, as well as the security considerations that need to be noted in order to implement it safely.

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange was the first widely used method of safely developing and exchanging keys over an insecure channel.
