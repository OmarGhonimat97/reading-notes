# Read: Hash Tables

## Hashtables

> What is a Hashtable?

Terminology:

1. Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
2. Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
3. Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.


> Why do we use them?

- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

Hash maps take advantage of an array’s O(1) read access. Instead of adding elements to an array from beginning to end, a hash map uses a “hash function” to place each item at a precise index location, based off it’s key.

> Structure

- Hashing

Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

- Creating a Hash

A hashtable traditionally is created from an array.

- Collisions

A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. 


## Internal Methods

- Add()
- Find()
- Contains()
- GetHash()

> Hashing is implemented in two steps:

1. An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.
2. The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

> Hash function

To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

1. Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.
2. Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.
3. Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.
