# Reading Notes

This is a repo to keep track of my observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout the course.
Is is a way to document and highlight my new knowledge. Publish it with GitHub pages, so it becomes a live web site.

### The Command Line

In the Bash Command Line Tutorial I learned about the terminal for the linux operating system. I learned basic navigation for moving around the system using the terminal. For example the command to enter into a file and view the files in it and move to the previous directory or the home directory also how to access hidden files and directories.
How to search for a specific command also search for the comman to do a certain objective.
Creating a file or a directory also deleting them. Also copying a directory which can be very useful in order to keep an original copy when I need to try something or make changes. Also moving a file which works in a similar way as the copy does.
When removving a non empty file or directory we use -r which means that we do it recursively
