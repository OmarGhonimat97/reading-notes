## Stacks and Queues

### What is a Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

> Common terminology for a stack is
1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3. Top - This is the top of the stack.
4. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO: First In Last Out
- LIFO: Last In First Out

> Push O(1)

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

> Pop O(1)

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

> Peek O(1)

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

> IsEmpty O(1)

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

### What is a Queue

> Common terminology for a queue is

1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

Queues follow these concepts:

- FIFO: First In First Out
- LILO: Last In Last Out

> Enqueue O(1)

When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

> Dequeue O(1)

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

> Peek O(1)

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

> IsEmpty O(1)

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
